# Jellyfin

Use cliamp to stream music from a Jellyfin server through Jellyfin's authenticated HTTP API. Jellyfin opens in an artists-first hierarchy by default: artist, then album, then songs.

> **Quick start:** Run `cliamp setup`. Select API-token or username+password authentication. The TUI validates `/Users/Me` and writes the `[jellyfin]` block. Manual steps follow.

## Prerequisites

- A reachable Jellyfin server
- At least one library with `CollectionType = music`
- A Jellyfin API token

## Configuration

Add a `[jellyfin]` section to `~/.config/cliamp/config.toml`:

```toml
[jellyfin]
url = "https://jellyfin.example.com"
user = "finamp"
password = "your_password_here"
# optional alternatives:
# token = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
# user_id = "00000000000000000000000000000000"
```

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `url` | Base URL of your Jellyfin server |
| `user` | Jellyfin username for password-based login |
| `password` | Jellyfin password for password login |
| `token` | Optional Jellyfin API token. Use it instead of a username and password. |
| `user_id` | Optional Jellyfin user id to skip discovery |

## Usage

After configuration, **Jellyfin** appears in the provider list.

To start cliamp with Jellyfin selected:

```bash
cliamp --provider jellyfin
```

Or set the provider in configuration:

```toml
provider = "jellyfin"
```

Jellyfin opens directly in **By Artist / Album** mode. Artists are listed alphabetically; selecting one opens their albums, and selecting an album opens its songs.

cliamp remembers the most recently played Jellyfin track, its playback position, and the complete album or track list it was chosen from, like every other provider (see [Last Session](configuration.md#last-session)). Queued tracks retain their own source context, including duplicate entries.

On the next launch with no explicit files, URLs, or playlist, cliamp restores that context with the last track selected. Press `Enter` to continue from the saved position. Saved stream URLs use current authentication when playback or preloading starts, including username-and-password sessions, without waiting for authentication during restoration. A saved Jellyfin track is restored only while Jellyfin is configured.

Press `N` while browsing Jellyfin to temporarily switch to **By Album** or **By Artist**. These alternate modes apply only to the current session; the next launch without a remembered track returns to **By Artist / Album**.

## How it works

cliamp authenticates with a configured token or the supplied username and password. It resolves the active Jellyfin user, lists music library views, derives an alphabetical artist index from the album catalog, then gets tracks for the selected album. Playback uses Jellyfin's authenticated audio endpoint and streams through the cliamp HTTP pipeline.

## Known limitations

- **Playback reporting**: cliamp reports now-playing status, progress, and stop
  events to Jellyfin, so the server can track play activity and history.
- **Token-based access**: Store the API token safely.
