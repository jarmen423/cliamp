# Keybindings

Press `Ctrl+K` in any mode, or `?` in the player, to view keybindings. The
keymap first shows commands for the active screen. It then shows player and
library commands.

To run a command, select it and press `Enter`. The command acts as if you
pressed its key on the screen that opened the keymap. Press `/` to filter the
list first. The keymap cannot run key pairs such as `Left` `Right`, the `N`
then `j` seek, or a player command while another screen is open. For these
entries, a status message tells you which key to press.

## Playback

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Space` | Play / Pause |
| `s` | Stop |
| `>` `.` | Next track |
| `<` `,` | Previous track |
| `Left` `Right` | Seek -/+5s |
| `Shift+Left` `Shift+Right` | Seek -/+30s (configurable) |
| `N` then `j` | Seek to N * 10% of the track (for example, `7j` jumps to 70%, `0j` to the start) |
| `+` `-` | Volume up/down |
| `]` `[` | Change speed by 0.25x |
| `m` | Toggle mono |
| `Ctrl+J` | Jump to time |

## Navigation

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab` | Cycle visible controls: Playlist / Source / Volume / EQ / Shuffle / Repeat / Speed / Playlist |
| `Shift+Tab` | Cycle the same controls in reverse |
| `j` `k` / `Up` `Down` | Move playlist cursor (wraps); see focused settings below for control actions |
| `PageUp` `PageDown` / `Ctrl+U` `Ctrl+D` | Scroll playlist/file browser by page (outside text input) |
| `Home` `End` / `g` `G` | Go to top/end of playlist/file browser |
| `Shift+Up` `Shift+Down` | Move track up/down in playlist/queue. Turn off shuffle to move a playlist track. |
| `h` `l` | Adjust the focused setting (EQ: select band) |
| `Enter` | Play selected track |
| `/` | Filter the playlist (navigate results with `↑` `↓` / `Ctrl+N` `Ctrl+P`; `Ctrl+U` clears the query; `Tab` toggles the queue for the selected result) |
| `Ctrl+X` | Expand/collapse playlist |
| `Ctrl+Z` | Undo the last playlist or queue change |
| `o` | Open file browser |
| `b` `Esc` | Back to provider |

In full and compact playback layouts, the first `Tab` from the playlist focuses
Source (`SRC`); `Shift+Tab` starts at Speed when it is visible. Source is skipped
when only one provider is available. Closing Settings skips EQ and Speed. A
short sidebar can omit Shuffle and Repeat together, removing both Tab stops.
Metadata is read-only and never a separate Tab stop.

In the minimal (`40x10`) and simplified layouts, `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` keep
playback focus on the playlist, even though simplified mode hides the list.
`Esc` still opens the separate provider-list view. Below `40x10`, only a resize
message is shown.

### Focused Settings

| Control | Keys |
|---|---|
| Source | `Left` `Right` / `h` `l` choose a provider; `Enter` opens it |
| Volume | `Right` `Up` / `l` `k` raise volume by 1 dB; `Left` `Down` / `h` `j` lower it |
| EQ | `Left` `Right` / `h` `l` select a band; `Up` `Down` / `k` `j` adjust its gain; `e` cycles presets |
| Shuffle | `Enter`, any arrow key, or `h` `j` `k` `l` toggles shuffle |
| Repeat | `Enter`, `Right` `Up` / `l` `k` cycle forward (Off / All / One); `Left` `Down` / `h` `j` cycle backward |
| Speed | `Right` `Up` / `l` `k` / `]` increase by 0.25x; `Left` `Down` / `h` `j` / `[` decrease by 0.25x |

## Text Input

Playlist and native-provider search, URL, playlist-name, keymap, jump, and
Home filter/new-playlist fields support these editor keys:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Left` `Right` / `Home` `End` | Move cursor |
| `Backspace` `Delete` | Delete before/at cursor |
| `Ctrl+W` | Delete previous word |
| `Ctrl+U` | Clear text before cursor |

The Metadata shortcut is inactive while a text input is active.

### Search and filter modes

`/` filters the list on the screen. `Ctrl+F` searches the active provider. In
Radio and Podcasts, `/` sends the query to the provider when you press
`Enter`.

While a search or filter input is open, its line starts with a badge that
names the mode and the source, such as `[Filter: Playlist]`, `[Filter: Files]`,
`[Search: Spotify]` or `[Search: Radio]`. The line ends with `Esc Exit`. Press
`Esc` to leave the input. On a narrow panel, the hint bar still shows `Esc`.

If the active provider has no `Ctrl+F` search, `Ctrl+F` searches YouTube. The
overlay shows `[Search: YouTube]` and names the provider that has no search.

After a Radio or Podcasts search, the provider header shows `Search results`
and the hint bar shows `Esc Clear search`. Press `Esc` to go back to the full
list.

## EQ and Appearance

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `e` | Cycle EQ preset, including the saved Custom curve |
| `t` | Choose theme |
| `v` | Cycle visualizer |
| `Ctrl+V` | Pick visualizer from a list (live preview) |
| `V` | Full screen visualizer. Inside it, `v` cycles modes, `<`/`>` change track, `+`/`-` change volume, and `t` hides the episode name, leaving only the bracketed source. |
| `Ctrl+H` | Toggle album headers |
| `Ctrl+G` | Toggle the key-binding hint bar (remembered in `hide_help_bar`) |
| `Ctrl+B` | Open/close the settings pane (remembered in `hide_settings_pane`) |

Theme and visualizer pickers support `/` filtering. While you browse, arrow
keys preview the selected option. `Enter` keeps it. `Esc` restores the option
active when the picker opened. While you type a filter, `Enter` completes it
and `Esc` clears it.

## Features

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `f` | Toggle bookmark ★ on the selected track. For directory radio stations outside saved local playlists, toggle Radio Favorites from the browser or playback playlist, including country and genre results. In the country browser, pin the selected country or region. On a podcast show, subscribe or unsubscribe. |
| `n` | Toggle favorite ♥ on the selected track while the playback playlist has focus. Favorited tracks appear in the cross-playlist "Favorites" virtual playlist. |
| `Ctrl+F` | Search with the active provider (Podcasts, Spotify, Qobuz, Tidal, Navidrome, Lyrion, Jellyfin, Emby, Plex, Audiobookshelf, Mixcloud, NetEase, Local), or search YouTube. Available in playlist and provider-browser views. The search line names the source. See [Search and filter modes](#search-and-filter-modes). |
| `u` | Load URL (stream/playlist) |
| `;` | Open the track context menu on the highlighted track |
| `W` (`Shift+W`) | Go to song radio: replace the queue with a radio seeded from the highlighted track and play it (Spotify's own station for the track; other providers with recommendation support use their recommendations) |
| `Ctrl+A` | Go to the highlighted track's album |
| `Ctrl+T` | Go to the highlighted track's artist |
| `d` | Open the audio device picker |
| `y` | Show or close lyrics |
| `r` | Retry lyrics lookup while lyrics are open |
| `[` / `]` | Adjust synced-lyrics timing offset (−/+250 ms) while lyrics show timestamped lines |
| `i` | From the playlist, open full info for the highlighted item, including Path (`Up`/`Down` or `j`/`k` scroll; `i`/`Esc` closes) |
| `Ctrl+I` | Toggle Metadata below Settings for the highlighted playlist item (remembered in `show_metadata`; requires a terminal that distinguishes Ctrl+I from Tab) |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save track to `[downloads].directory` (default `~/Music/cliamp`) |
| `w` | Write the highlighted track/selection to a playlist — local playlists always, plus the owning provider's playlists (a "Spotify Playlists" section, with new-playlist creation) when the tracks come from it; selections are added in batches |
| `N` | Open the active provider browser. On a selected Mixcloud show, open that creator's Uploads/Favorites. In the radio pane, open the country browser. |
| `H` | Open the Home view — the active provider's library in a two-pane browser |
| `I` (`Shift+I`) | Toggle the immersive layout (prototype): visualizer band, nav pills, Now Playing + Queue column, canvas with list/rows/grid views, transport row and seek bar; `I` or `Esc` exits back. See [Immersive mode](#immersive-mode-prototype) |
| `L` | Browse local playlists (with cliamp radio) |
| `R` | Open radio provider |
| `O` (`Shift+O`) | Open Podcasts provider |
| `S` | Open Spotify provider |
| `P` | Open Plex provider |
| `J` | Open Jellyfin provider |
| `E` | Open Emby provider |
| `Y` | Open YouTube provider |
| `C` | Open SoundCloud provider |
| `X` | Open Mixcloud provider |
| `M` | Open NetEase provider |
| `Q` | Open Qobuz provider |
| `T` | Open Tidal provider |
| `B` | Open Audiobookshelf provider |

Metadata belongs to the main playback view, not provider browsers, and follows
the highlighted playlist row even when another item is playing. Enabling it
without a usable Settings sidebar opens the full info overlay instead; the
preference remains saved for a wider layout. See
[Metadata](configuration.md#metadata) for fields and layout behavior.

### Track context menu

Opened with `;` on the highlighted track, or by right-clicking a track row
(see [Mouse](#mouse)). Items act on the track under the cursor or click, not
the playing one. Availability follows the provider: "Go to song radio" needs
recommendation support (Spotify), album/artist navigation needs the track to
name them, and "Remove from this playlist" only appears on playlist, queue,
and playlist-manager rows.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `w` | Add the track to a playlist (the same picker as `w` in the playlist) |
| `r` | Go to song radio: the track, then its radio, as the new queue |
| `R` | Go to artist radio (providers that can load the artist and recommend, e.g. Spotify) |
| `b` | Go to album radio (providers that record the album, can load it, and can recommend, e.g. Spotify) |
| `a` | Add to queue — toggles the play-next slot for playlist rows, queues elsewhere |
| `l` | Go to the track's album |
| `t` | Go to the track's artist |
| `x` | Remove from this playlist (or queue) — playlist/queue/manager rows only |
| `s` | Like / unlike on the owning provider (e.g. Spotify Liked Songs) — providers with likes only |
| `i` | View credits — composer/producer/label metadata where the provider exposes it, plus the track's standard metadata; reports when no credits are exposed (Spotify has no credits endpoint) |
| `y` | Copy a share link to the clipboard: the open.spotify.com link for Spotify tracks, or a `cliamp://play` link for web streams |
| `Enter` | Run the highlighted item |
| `j` `k` / `Up` `Down` | Move between items (wraps) |
| `;` `q` `Esc` | Close |

Inside the credits view: `Up`/`Down` (`j`/`k`) or `Ctrl+U`/`Ctrl+D` scroll;
`i`/`q`/`Esc` closes.

### Mouse

On terminals with mouse reporting enabled:

| Pointer | Action |
|---|---|
| Left click on the progress bar | Seek to that position |
| Left drag on the progress bar | Scrub — the seek lands where the button is released |
| Left click on a track row | Move that surface's cursor to the row |
| Double click on a track row | Act on the row as `Enter` does on that surface (play it in the playlist) |
| Right click on a track row | Open the track context menu (above) for the row |
| Wheel | Scroll the active list |

Terminals that do not support mouse reporting behave exactly as before —
every action here also has a keyboard equivalent.

## Playlist and Queue

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `a` | Toggle the queue (play next) |
| `A` | Queue manager |
| `F` | Subscribed shows overlay (any provider that keeps subscriptions) |
| `x` | Remove the highlighted track from the current playlist — and from the remote playlist the queue mirrors (Spotify) |
| `*` | Like/unlike the highlighted track on its provider (Spotify) |
| `p` | Playlist manager |
| `r` | Cycle repeat mode (Off / All / One) |
| `z` | Toggle shuffle |
| `Z` | Toggle Smart Shuffle — recommended tracks mix into the end of the queue (Spotify queues; rows marked ✚) |

While shuffle is on, the playlist lists tracks in play order. The tracks that
played before the current track are above it. The tracks that play next are
below it. Each row keeps its original track number. When you turn off shuffle,
the playlist returns to the original order and the cursor stays on the same
track.

### Inside the subscribed shows overlay

`F` lists the shows you subscribed to, without touching the network. Unlike
`Enter` in the provider list, every action here appends, so the playlist and
the queue survive.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` | Move cursor (wraps) |
| `/` | Filter by show title or author; `Enter` applies, `Esc` clears |
| `Enter` | Append the show's episodes and play the first appended |
| `a` | Append the show's episodes, leaving playback alone |
| `q` | Append the show's episodes and queue them in feed order |
| `l` | Append only the newest episode and add it to the end of the queue |
| `L` | Append the newest episode of every subscribed show |
| `Esc` `F` | Close |

`L` fetches feeds concurrently and keeps subscription order. Shows whose feed
fails are counted in the overlay's error line rather than dropped silently.
### Inside the save-to-playlist picker

Reached with `w`. The list shows your saved playlists plus a **New playlist**
row at the end.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | Add the tracks to the end of the selected playlist, or create a new one |
| `p` | Add the tracks to the start of the selected playlist instead |
| `Esc` `q` | Cancel |

`Enter` skips tracks the playlist already holds. `p` moves them to the front
instead, since putting a track first is an ordering request rather than a
duplicate. Tracks the playlist only holds through a `[[dir]]` source cannot be
reordered, so `p` leaves them alone and reports them as skipped.

### Inside the playlist manager

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` | Move cursor |
| `/` | Filter (incremental); `Esc` clears |
| `Enter` / `→` | List screen: open the selected playlist. Tracks screen: play the **selected** track. |
| `p` | Tracks screen: play all from the top |
| `w` | List: save the current queue with the playlist picker. Tracks: copy marked or selected tracks to another playlist. |
| `Space` | Tracks: mark/unmark highlighted track and advance |
| `[` `]` | Tracks: move highlighted track and save the playlist |
| `s` | Tracks: sort and save, cycling `track`, `title`, `artist`, `album`, `artist+album`, `path` |
| `o` | Tracks: open file browser to add files to this playlist |
| `D` | List: open the file browser to add `[[dir]]` sources to the selected playlist. Tracks: open the directory-sources screen. |
| `a` | List: create a playlist. After naming it, the file browser opens at `~`. Use `Enter` to enter a directory, `Space` to select folders or files, `Enter` to confirm, or `Esc` to finish. Tracks: mark or unmark all visible tracks. |
| `r` | List: rename the playlist (`Recently Played` cannot be renamed) |
| `d` | List: delete playlist (confirms; `Recently Played` cannot be deleted). Tracks: remove marked tracks, or highlighted track when none are marked |
| `A` | List: append the selected playlist to the current one, keeping what is loaded. Tracks: append the marked tracks, or the highlighted one. |
| `u` | Undo the last manager edit |
| `←` `Backspace` `h` | Tracks screen: go back to the list |
| `Esc` | Close the playlist manager or go back |

Shift-letter keys switch providers. Playlist-manager track actions use lowercase
or punctuation keys. `D` is the exception. It opens the directory-sources
screen.

#### Directory sources screen (`D` from the tracks screen)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` | Navigate directory sources |
| `a` | Open the file browser to add a directory as a `[[dir]]` source |
| `d` then `y` | Remove the selected source. `y` confirms; any other key cancels. |
| `r` | Toggle `recursive` on the highlighted source |
| `←` `Backspace` `h` `Esc` | Back to the tracks screen |

## File browser

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` | Move cursor |
| `←` `→` / `h` `l` / `Enter` | Go back; open a directory or file |
| `/` | Filter files |
| `Space` | Select or unselect file/directory |
| `a` | Select/unselect all visible audio files |
| `R` | Replace the current queue with selected files (confirm when it is non-empty) |
| `w` | Write selected files to a local playlist |
| `D` | Add selected folders as live `[[dir]]` sources to the target playlist. If none are selected, add the selected folder or the open directory. The browser stays open. |
| `~` `.` | Jump to home / current working directory |
| `Esc` `o` | Close file browser |

When the browser adds to a playlist, selected folders become `[[dir]]` sources.
Selected audio files become explicit tracks. This mode starts when you open the
browser with `D` from the manager list, with `o` from the tracks screen, or
after you create a playlist with `a`. In this mode, `Esc` means "done". cliamp
commits pending selections before it closes the browser.

## Provider browser (`N` key)

Press `N` to open a provider. These providers share the browser keys below:
Navidrome, Lyrion, Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Audiobookshelf, Spotify, Qobuz,
Tidal, Mixcloud, Podcasts, and YouTube Music. Artist and album screens exist
only where the provider implements them: Navidrome, Lyrion, Jellyfin, Emby,
Audiobookshelf, Qobuz, Tidal, and Mixcloud. Podcasts reuses those screens for
categories and shows. Plex, Spotify, and YouTube Music have no artist or album
screens; their playlists — and, for Plex and Spotify, saved albums — appear in
the provider pane.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` | Move cursor (wraps from top to bottom) |
| `←` `→` / `h` `l` | Go back; open the selected item |
| `/` | Filter the visible list, including Radio's complete genre/tag index. In the Mixcloud Genres list, `Enter` searches the complete server-side genre/tag catalog. |
| `f` | In the Mixcloud Genres list, favorite or unfavorite the selected genre locally. Update `[mixcloud].styles`. On a podcast show, subscribe or unsubscribe. |
| `l` | Provider list, on a podcast show row only: append its newest episode and add it to the end of the queue, without replacing the playlist. Elsewhere in the browser `l` opens the selected item. |
| `a` | Append all visible tracks to the queue. Provider list, on a podcast show row only: append every episode without replacing the playlist. |
| `Enter` | Open the selected artist (artist page where supported — Spotify; otherwise their albums or tracks) or album. A Radio tag loads up to 200 matching stations; a selected track plays and queues the rest of the visible list. |
| `R` | Replace the queue with all visible tracks (start from the top, confirm when non-empty) |
| `q` | Queue the highlighted track to play next |
| `f` | Follow/unfollow the highlighted artist (artist list; Spotify) |
| `s` | Cycle album sort (album list only) |
| `*` | Like/unlike the highlighted track (track screen; Spotify) |
| `S` `N` `P` `J` `E` `Y` `C` `X` `M` `Q` `T` `L` `O` | Switch to that provider without opening the main pane. `R` replaces the queue on the track screen. |
| `Esc` `b` | Go back one level; close the browser |

The Mixcloud browser menu has **By Show**, **By Creator**, **By Creator / Show**,
and **Genres**. Genre favorites add Latest/Popular rows to the provider pane and
show-sort menu. They do not change the Mixcloud website account. The header
shows a source path such as `Navidrome / Miles Davis / Kind of Blue / Tracks`.
This keeps the current provider and open location visible. Track rows show
right-aligned durations when the provider provides them.

For Mixcloud, selecting a Show, a creator Uploads/Favorites collection, or a
genre Latest/Popular view replaces the main playlist and closes the browser. An
empty result leaves the current playlist and browser unchanged.

For Podcasts, **Browse Categories** opens **Genre**, then **Show**. `Enter` on a
show replaces the main playlist with its episodes without starting playback.
Then `Enter` plays an episode and `a` toggles its play-next queue entry.

## Provider playlist list

The playlists pane appears when the focus is on a provider, such as Spotify,
Navidrome, Podcasts, or Local Playlists:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` | Move cursor (wraps) |
| `Ctrl+U` `Ctrl+D` | Scroll by page |
| `Enter` | Load the selected playlist tracks into the queue |
| `/` | Filter the playlist list. In Podcasts, type a show name or publisher RSS URL, then `Enter` to search; typing alone sends no search requests. |
| `f` | In Podcasts, subscribe or unsubscribe from the selected show |
| `Ctrl+F` | Run the provider online or server search (Spotify, Navidrome, NetEase, and others). |
| `Ctrl+R` | Refresh the provider: reload the currently open playlist or starting wave in place (e.g. a fresh Yandex "Моя волна" batch), or return to the playlist list. For Mixcloud, also clear the cached `/me/` identity. |
| `p` | Open the playlist manager (Local pane only; create, rename, delete, add dirs/tracks) |
| `D` | Delete (owned) / unfollow (followed) the highlighted playlist — inline confirm, `Enter`/`y` confirms (Spotify) |
| `r` | Rename the highlighted playlist you own — inline input (Spotify) |
| `S` `N` `P` `J` `E` `Y` `C` `X` `M` `Q` `L` `R` `O` | Switch to that provider |
| `Tab` | Leave the provider pane and focus Source, or the first visible playback control |
| `Shift+Tab` | Leave the provider pane and focus the last visible playback control (Speed, or Repeat with Settings closed) |
| `Esc` `b` | Back to the playlist pane; in Podcasts, clear show search first |

Playlist rows show `Name · N tracks · 1h 23m` when the provider returns track
counts and total duration. The header shows `Provider / Playlists`. The loaded
playlist has a `▶` prefix. Spotify groups playlists under section headers (`── library ──` with Your Music, Top Tracks, and Recently Played, `── your playlists ──`, `── followed playlists ──`, and `── saved albums ──`). Large Spotify playlists load incrementally: the first tracks appear immediately and the rest stream in behind a "Loading more tracks…" indicator. For configured accounts, Mixcloud shows Your Mixcloud first: Stream, then Favorites. It then
## Search results overlays

Use these keys when `Ctrl+F` opens provider search or YouTube/SoundCloud network
search and the results list is open:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` / `Ctrl+N` `Ctrl+P` | Move cursor (single item) |
| `Ctrl+U` `Ctrl+D` | Scroll results by page |
| `←` `→` / `Tab` `Shift+Tab` | Switch result tab — Tracks / Albums / Artists / Playlists, each with a count (multi-type provider search: Spotify) |
| `Enter` | Play the selected track now · multi-type results: drill into the highlighted album (its tracks) or playlist (its tracks), or open the highlighted artist's page (Spotify; other providers load their album list) |
| `a` | Append the selected track to the playlist |
| `q` | Queue the selected track to play next |
| `f` | In Podcasts, subscribe or unsubscribe from the selected show. On the Artists / Playlists tabs (Spotify), follow/unfollow the highlighted artist or followed playlist — owned playlists are deleted via `D` in the provider pane. |
| `p` | (Spotify only) Add the selected track to a Spotify playlist |
| `S` | (Spotify only) Like/unlike the selected track (track tab) |
| `Esc` `Backspace` | Back to the search input · from a drill-down list, up one level |

Drill-down lists (album, artist, and playlist tracks) carry the same track actions as the track tab — `Enter` play, `a` append, `q` queue next, `p` add-to-playlist, `S` like — and show a breadcrumb of the drill path above the list. Backing out of the last drill level returns to the tab bar with the previous tab and cursor intact.
Podcasts returns show collections (up to 20), not episodes. `Enter` appends the
feed's episodes and starts the first; `a` appends them and starts the first if
the playlist was empty or nothing is playing. `q` appends and queues the
episodes in feed order after any already queued tracks, starting queued
playback if nothing is playing.

## Fuzzy search

Local search boxes use fuzzy matching. Query characters must appear in order but
do not need to be next to each other. Results are ranked by relevance, with the
best match first. For example, `skr` and `saku` both find a track named "Sakura".

This applies to:

- `/` playlist search
- `/` file browser filter
- `Ctrl+F` when the active provider is Local (your saved playlists)

Other `Ctrl+F` providers, including Spotify, Qobuz, Tidal, Navidrome, Lyrion,
Jellyfin, Emby, Plex, Audiobookshelf, Mixcloud, NetEase, Podcasts, and YouTube, send the
query to their search API. Their services control matching rules.

## General

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `?` / `Ctrl+K` | Show keymap. `Enter` runs the selected command. |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

## Immersive mode (prototype)

`I` opens the immersive layout (or start in it with `immersive = true` in the
config). It falls back to the classic layout when the terminal is under
80x24. Transport keys keep their normal bindings (`Space`, `>`/`<`, `r`, `Z`,
`+`/`-`, `Shift+Left`/`Shift+Right`, `v` to cycle visualizers); `Ctrl+K` or
`?` lists everything below. The immersive-only keys:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `1`..`5` | Switch nav pill: Playlists, Artists, Search, Albums, Podcasts |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Cycle focus between nav row, canvas, and queue |
| `h`/`l` or `Left`/`Right` | Move cursor horizontally (nav pills, grid tiles, settings values) |
| `j`/`k` or `Up`/`Down` | Move cursor vertically (one row or tile row per step) |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Page the canvas |
| `Enter` | Open the focused collection, play the focused track, or adjust a setting |
| `Backspace` or `Alt+Left` | Back through the canvas history (the ◀ button) |
| `Alt+Right` | Forward again (the ▶ button) |
| `Esc` | Leave the settings tab or an opened collection; exits at the root |
| `g` or `Home` | Jump back to the canvas root |
| `c` | Cycle the canvas view: list, rows, grid |
| `z` | Shuffle button: off, shuffle, Smart Shuffle (✦), off |
| `;` | Track menu for the focused track (also right-click) |
| `e` | Toggle the settings tab in the canvas (EQ preset/bands, volume, speed, visualizer) |
| `t` | Cycle track sort: order, title, album, duration |
| `s` | Toggle browse sort: recents vs alphabetical |
| `f` | Filter the current browse list |
| `/` or `Ctrl+F` | Search into the canvas. Suggestions drop down as you type: `Up`/`Down` pick one and `Enter` opens it; `Enter` with none picked lists every result. Artists whose name matches come first |
| `p` | Play the open collection from the cursor |
| `a` | Queue the focused track |
| `n` | Toggle favorite on the focused track |
| `q` | Focus the Queue panel (queue clicks jump the live queue there) |
| `Q` | Queue page in the canvas: Now playing, Next in queue, and Next up from the playing context (in shuffled order when shuffle is on). `Enter` jumps there, `x` removes a queued track, `Shift+Up`/`Shift+Down` move it, `;` opens the track menu, `Q` or `Esc` goes back |
| `R` | Radio: in an open playlist, album or artist, radio for that collection; in a list, radio for the focused artist, album or playlist, or song radio for a focused track. The radio starts playing as a new playlist: it opens in the canvas as its own page (`Backspace` returns to where you were) and the Queue panel shows it as "Next from … Radio". On Spotify it is Spotify's station for the seed; other providers with recommendations mix a spread of the collection's tracks with them |
| `V` | Full-screen visualizer |
| `I` or `Esc` | Exit immersive mode |

Mouse: click pills to switch, click a playlist, album or artist to open it,
double-click a track to play it, double-click a queue row to jump there, click
the Queue panel's title to open the queue page, double-click the visualizer
for full screen, click a search suggestion to open it, right-click a track,
queue row, or Now Playing for the track menu (add to playlist, song radio,
queue, go to album/artist, like, credits, copy share link), click the
transport buttons, drag the seek bar, and wheel over the canvas or queue to
snap-scroll. Search results open albums on Enter and play tracks.
